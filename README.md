# Plugins for Vellum
These are plugins I've created for [**Vellum**](https://www.github.com/clarkx86/vellum), a server management program for Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server.

The plugins here are compatible with the normal version of BDS. For plugins that require the [**ElementZero**](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero) modified version version of BDS, see [**my other repo**](https://www.github.com/tomrhollis/VellumZero-Plugin)

## Current Plugins
- [**AutoRestart**](AutoRestart): schedule daily restarts for your server, with notifications to users beforehand

## Compatibility
These plugins are compiled to run on with both Windows and Linux versions of Vellum, but are only tested on Windows.  Please let me know if you run into any problems (in either Linux or Windows) by making an issue on the issue tracker.
