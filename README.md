# Plugins for Vellum

These are plugins I've created for [**Vellum**](https://www.github.com/clarkx86/vellum), a server management program for Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server.

The plugins here are compatible with the normal version of BDS. For plugins that require the [**ElementZero**](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero) modified version version of BDS, see [**my other repo**](https://www.github.com/tomrhollis/VellumZero-Plugin)

## Current Plugins

- [**AutoRestart**](AutoRestart): schedule daily restarts for your server, with notifications to users beforehand
